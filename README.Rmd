# {pedant} <img src="man/figures/logo.png" align="right" width="200" />
`{pedant}` lets you quickly transform R code to *pedantically* use implicit
function calls instead of implicit, either by running `add_double_colons()` or
using the handy RStudio addin `"Make function calls explicit"`.

![RStudio addin demo](man/figures/addin-demo.gif){width=75%}

# Installation
You can install the development version using
``` r
remotes::install_github("wurli/pedant")
```

# Usage
If you're developing a package, `{pedant}` will look at the `DESCRIPTION` and
`NAMESPACE` files to work out which packages to use when making functions 
explicit. Otherwise it will use the currently attached packages, i.e.
the ones already loaded using `library()`. You can manually specify the
packages to look in using the `use_packages` argument to `add_double_colons()`:
```{r}
library(dplyr, warn.conflicts = FALSE)

code <- 
 "mtcars %>%
    filter(mpg > 20) %>%
    summarise(across(everything(), n_distinct))"

# Code will be transformed to use the double-colon operator, but notice
# that `n_distinct` is not transformed as it is not followed by `()`
cat(add_double_colons(code))
```

# Why?
Often, during package development I forget to use explicit function calls and
am then faced with the onerous task of cleaning up my own code. I wrote this
package so I can continue this bad habit.
